# Explanation of Q4

## What I changed

I applied data augmentation to the training data generation process.
More specifically, I modified the code that generates training images so that each image has a small probability of being corrupted:
- 85% clean
- 5% Gaussian noise
- 5% blurring
- 5% black square occlusion

Only one type of corruption is applied to each image.

## Why I think it helps

The test images contain noise and occlusion, while the original training set is fully clean.
This mismatch causes the encoder to produce unstable latent features when evaluated on the noisy test images.
Introducing a small amount of similar corruption into the training data reduces this mismatch.
The encoder becomes less sensitive to noise and occlusion, and its latent space reflects shape structure more consistently.
Using too much corruption hurts reconstruction, but a small amount (around 10–20%) improves robustness.

## The result

The best-layer shape accuracy increased from 81.63% to 84.95%, showing that moderate corruption improves the representation quality for shape.
