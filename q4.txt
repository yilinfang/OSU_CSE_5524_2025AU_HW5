# Explanation of Q4

## What I changed

I applied data augmentation techniques to the training dataset.
More specifically, I added noise to 15% of the training samples with Gaussian noise, blurring, and geometric transformations (add black square to the shape).

## Why I think it helps

__TODO__

## The result

Resulting shape accuracy of the best layer increased from 81.63% to 84.95%.
